{
  "overall_feedback": {
    "formatting": {
      "font_consistency": "The font appears consistent throughout the document, which is good for readability.",
      "section_ordering": "The section ordering is generally good, logical, and follows a standard format (Summary, Education, Experience, Projects, Skills, Leadership, Involvement, Achievements, Certifications).  However, 'Achievements' could be integrated into the relevant sections (Projects, Leadership, etc.) for better context.",
      "readability": "The resume is highly readable due to clear section headings and bullet points.  The use of bold text for key information (titles, dates, metrics) is effective.  Spacing is adequate, preventing the resume from feeling cramped.  The use of abbreviations like 'Q' and brackets is not standard, and those items should be spelled out.",
      "spacing_and_layout": "Good use of white space.  The layout is clean and uncluttered.  Bullet points are well-aligned.",
      "visual_appeal": "The resume is visually appealing due to its clean structure. Consider using a slightly larger font size for the name and contact information to make it stand out more."
    },
    "general_comments": "This is a strong resume for a computer science student. It showcases a good balance of technical skills, projects, and experience. The level of detail provided for the projects is excellent. The candidate demonstrates a proactive approach to learning and development.  The main areas for improvement are in making the language more impactful and quantifiable, and removing non-standard abbreviations."

  "section_wise_feedback": {
    "summary": {
      "comments": "The summary is good but can be made more impactful.  Instead of simply listing skills, highlight *how* those skills have been used and what impact they've had.  Tailor the summary to the specific type of role being sought.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Instead of 'Enthusiastic Computer Science student skilled in...', try 'Highly motivated Computer Science student with proven skills in Python, Flask, and Machine Learning, demonstrated through successful project development and research contributions.'",
        "Quantify the impact: '...creating innovative solutions that improved X by Y%.' (if possible, replace X and Y with specifics)",

        "Expand on the types of datasets used (e.g., image, video, sensor data)."
      ]
    },
    "projects": {
      "comments": "This is a very strong section with a good selection of projects demonstrating a wide range of skills. The descriptions are detailed, but can be further improved with quantification and impact.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Instead of listing tools, focus on the *outcomes* and *impact* of using those tools. For example, for the 'NFC X CV Real time Attendance System', instead of 'Developed a Real time Attendance System...', try 'Automated attendance tracking using NFC and Computer Vision, reducing attendance errors by X% and saving Y hours of administrative time per week.'",
        "For 'BREEZE', quantify the benefits. '...helping Coastal Tourists by providing X, Y, and Z, resulting in a U% increase in user satisfaction (or some other metric).'  What specific information does the app provide?",
        "For 'TOX-MAS', be more specific about the 'DL models' and 'NLP Techniques' used.  What was the accuracy of the model?  How was 'explicit content' defined?",
        "For 'Air Quality Predictor', quantify the accuracy of the predictions.  How does it compare to existing solutions?",
        "Remove the brackets and abbreviations like '[Q]' and spell those out or remove them entirely, as they do not appear to point to anything."
      ]
    },
    "skills": {
      "comments": "The skills section is comprehensive. Consider categorizing skills further for better organization.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Instead of separate categories for 'Web Technologies', 'Database Systems', etc., consider broader categories like 'Programming Languages', 'Web Development' (combining technologies and frameworks), 'Databases', 'Cloud Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Tools'.",
        "Remove 'AIML' and place those items under a 'Machine Learning' category.  'AIML' is redundant with other items listed.",
        "Remove 'ChatGPT' and 'Claude' unless you have significantly *developed* with their APIs.  Simply *using* them isn't a distinguishing skill."
